				<h1 align="center"> About Zimbabwean Food</h1>
				<br>
				<p class="text">Food from Zimbabwe comes in a variety of flavours and colours. 
					<br />
					The country has developed a variety in its culture, rituals, 
					lifestyle, and cuisine with the arrival of European colonists.
					Salted groundnuts, sadza and relish, and peanut butter rice are a few of 
					the well-known Zimbabwean recipes for food.
					The people of Zimbabwe have adopted some English traditions because the country was a British colony.
					For instance, the majority of people eat porridge for breakfast yet continue to drink midday tea,
					often known as 10 o'clock tea, in the afternoon. They consume lunch, which could
					consist of leftovers from the night before, 
					freshly boiled sadza, or sandwiches (which are typically consumed in cities).
					Following lunch, tea is typically served at 4 o'clock, followed by dinner.
