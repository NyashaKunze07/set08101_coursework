						Zimbabwean food comes in different shades of colour and flavor. 
						After colonisation, the country has taken on a change in its culture, rituals, lifestyle and diet.
						Zimbabwe was a British colony, so people followed British customs.
						Trading with the Portuguese also influenced the cuisine, as a result, most of Zimbabwe's food recipes include peanuts.
						Apart from these recipes, people make their living from staple foods such as sadza and/or selling maize. 
						Althought meat is a big part of our culture, most families tend to enjoy meat on special occasions such as weddings, 
						birthdays or the Christmas celebration. The Zimbabwean weather is also favourable for fruits, 
						which are usually enjoyed during the Christmas season as Zimbabwe is in the Southern Hemisphere..
