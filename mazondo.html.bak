		<h4> To do </h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Get your ingredients together </li>
				<li>Put your cleaned heels in a pot. 
					Add enough water to just cover the mazondo.
					Season with 1 tsp salt.
					Bring to the boil then reduce heat to a very gentle simmer.</li>
				<li>Allow to cook for about 3 hrs or until the Mazondo are lovely and tender but still holding up their shape.</li>
				<li>Drain any excess fat that may have come out from the cow heels during the cooking (leaving only about 2 tbsp).</li>
				<li>Add chopped onion, curry powder, tomato and tomato paste to the pot together with 100 ml of water (if the water in the pot is finished).</li>
				<li>Add 1/2 tsp salt and allow to simmer until the tomatoes and onions are cooked and the soup is not runny.
					(if you find your soup is runny, mix 1 tsp of flour with water to make a paste then pour into the pot.
					Give a good stir and allow to simmer for another 5 min).</li>
				<li>Taste for seasoning and adjust accordingly.</li> 
				<li>Enjoy!</li>
